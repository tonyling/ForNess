							<dt>Just What is a Koala Bear?</dt>
								<dd>Koala bear, A.K.A. "Ness", is a type of animal that loves to eat!  You know you spotted one when you see a walking apple with fur and flapping ears.</dd>
							<dt>Habitats of Koala Bear</dt>
								<dd>Koala bears have been known to make their dens throughout a house.  Some of theses locations include couches, man caves, and even chairs. <br><br>  You know you have stumbled upon the dwelling of a koala bear when you hear a sudden snore and funny noises.  Do not panic!  Such sounds are only of the koala bear talking in it's sleep.</dd>
							<dt>Personality of Koala Bear</dt>
								<dd>Although koala bears might appear grumpy and mean due to their unusal eating and sleeping habbits, theses creatures are actually quite gentle and kind. <br><br> They are caring, funny, generous, loving and most of all, huggable creatures!</dd>
