CHANGE LOG
__________

1/1/2013		Added jQuery 1.8.3 library, as well as own coded jscript.js, both files located within 'src' folder.
			Check out the javascript, .js, files if you wanna look into how javascript is implemented.
		
			1.	Navigation DIV elements(ie Main/Photos/RealPhotos) changed so clicking on them redirects.
				This makes it so you don't need to be precise and click on the links direclty, just the bubble.

			2.	Added fading background layer when you click an image.  The image pops up, centers onto
				the screen, and background gets darker.  When you click on background or image, screen
				goes back to normal.

			3.	Header Koala's nose glow.  When clicked, opens up image of letter koala wrote me for valentine's day.
				background img from 'http://www.goodfon.com/wallpaper/124390.html'

1/5/2013		Added fadeIn(300) for both #bgFade and #tempimg.  Less dramatic with picture poping instantly.
